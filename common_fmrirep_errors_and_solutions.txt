fmriprep is a wonderful tool, but occasionally there will be errors that will appear in your html reports and/or log files. 
This is a compilation of errors I've seen, and steps to resolve them

1). Memory issues: "PBS: job killed: vmem 139623743488 exceeded limit 85899345920"
	This is a common error to find, where fmriprep consumes too much memory, thus causing the job to crash. There are two solutions to this:
		a). Re-run the job. Sometimes fmriprep is fickle when it comes to memory allocation, so re-running without changes can oftentimes resolve the issue.
		b). Allocate more memory for your job.  

2). ICA-AROMA issue: "ERROR:: too many components selected"
	This only occurs if your fmriprep command includes the --use-aroma flag option. This probably means that the functional run that this error pertains to has too few volumes. To check the number of volumes in a run, do:
		a). (in afni): 3dinfo -nv sub-subjID_task-taskname_run-runID_bold.nii.gz 
		b). (in fsl): fslinfo sub-subjID_task-taskname_run-runID_bold.nii.gz | grep dim4
	The output is the number of volumes in the functional run, which is likely too little, meaning that it was cut short for some reason

3). BIDS error: Anything mentioning "BIDS" in the error reports/files.
	If you don't select --skip_bids_validation in your fmriprep command, BIDS validation will be performed at the start, which will detect any validation issues early on.
	This can take some time though, so if you do skip the validation, fmriprep's preprocessing will begin faster, but errors pertaining to the validation may crop up later
	To fix this:
		a). Use the online BIDS validator (https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator) to ensure that your data is in proper BIDS format.
